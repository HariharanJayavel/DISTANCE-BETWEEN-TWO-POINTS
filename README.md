# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Get the four coordinate values from the user 
### Step 2:
Use import.math to assign the distance formula
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
Round the value up to two decimal values and the print values it would be calculated
### Step 5:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
# Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(round(distance,2))
